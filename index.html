  <h2>Defenition of operating systems :</h2>
  <h3>An Operating system (OS) is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. Every computer      
           must   have at least one OS to run other programs. An application like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs some environment in     
          which it   will run and perform its task. The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the     
         computer's   language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating  system.</h3>
