      <h2>Types of Operating system: - </h2>
       <h3>1-Batch Operating System</h3>
        <p>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.

The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer. In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like a punch card and submit it to the computer operator</p>

       <h3>2-Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems</h3>
        <p>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</p>

 <h3>3-Real time OS</h3>
        <p>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems.</p>

 <h3>4-Distributed Operating System</h3>
        <p>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</p>

 <h3>5-Network Operating System</h3>
        <p>Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</p>


 <h3>6-Mobile OS</h3>
        <p>Mobile operating systems are those OS which is especially that are designed to power smartphones, tablets, and wearables devices.</p>
